Based in Russia, Moscow, our brewery was founded in 2023 by Varsava Platonov. She was determined to create a company purposed with doing good through great beer. Our motto “Do what's right” is at the forefront of every decision we make from how we treat our employees, to the beer we brew, to taking care of the world around us. We’re known for our IPAs, pale ales, and our commitment to the environment as a member of 1% for the Planet.
